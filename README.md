## My OpenGL Project!

Making an OpenGL program for class, more info soon!

In order to use the code, click on generate.bat to make your solution. It is set to vs2022, change the value according to your needs.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file you're reading.

← `Main.cpp`: This is the main file.

← `Generate.bat`: A batch file my friend [BetterDrgn](https://github.com/BttrDrgn) taught me to make, it allows you generate your own solution to avoid issues.

← `Premake.lua`: Lua script to generate the solution.

← `Premake.exe`: Exe file the lua script uses to generate the solution.

## What does the program have currently?

← `Screen`: That's the code that generates the OpenGL window, and changes the version if your PC cant handle OpenGL 4.6.

← `Input`: This is the file that manages Input.

← `Objects`: Currently it just draws a moving cube to the screen, however, it will do more in the future!
